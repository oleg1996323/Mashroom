/*
 * find next grib header
 *
 * file = what do you think?
 * pos = initial position to start looking at  ( = 0 for 1st call)
 *       returns with position of next grib header (units=bytes)
 * len_grib = length of the grib record (bytes)
 * buffer[buf_len] = buffer for reading/writing
 *
 * returns (char *) to start of GRIB header+PDS
 *         NULL if not found
 *
 * adapted from SKGB (Mark Iredell)
 *
 * v1.1 9/94 Wesley Ebisuzaki
 * v1.2 3/96 Wesley Ebisuzaki handles short records at end of file
 * v1.3 8/96 Wesley Ebisuzaki increase NTRY from 3 to 100 for the folks
 *      at Automation decided a 21 byte WMO bulletin header wasn't long 
 *      enough and decided to go to an 8K header.  
 * v1.4 11/10/2001 D. Haalman, looks at entire file, does not try
 *      to read past EOF
 *      3/8/2010 echack added by Brian Doty
 * v1.5 5/2011 changes for ECMWF who have grib1+grib2 files, scan entire file
